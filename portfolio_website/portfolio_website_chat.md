<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">GitHub Copilot:</span> To create a visually appealing, organized, and fully responsive portfolio website using vanilla JavaScript, I’ll set up a basic project structure and implement the main HTML, CSS, and JS files. The site will include the following sections: Hero, About, Skills, Experience, Education, Certification, Projects, and Contact. The design will be modern, clean, and optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop.

Here’s the plan:
1. Create the following files:
   - `index.html` (main structure)
   - `styles.css` (responsive styles)
   - `script.js` (basic interactivity)
2. Structure the HTML with semantic tags and section IDs.
3. Add a responsive navigation bar.
4. Style each section for visual appeal and responsiveness.
5. Add basic JS for navigation and interactivity.

I’ll start by creating these files and implementing the initial content and layout.
