rajenderk18: Create a Python script that reads a CSV file containing user data with email addresses, validates each email using regex, and outputs a report showing valid and invalid emails. Include error handling for file operations.

GitHub Copilot: Made changes.

The script csv_email_validator.py has been created. It reads a CSV file with user data, validates email addresses using regex, and outputs a report of valid and invalid emails. It also includes error handling for file operations.

To use it, run:
```
python csv_email_validator.py <csv_file_path>
```
Replace `<csv_file_path>` with the path to your CSV file. Let me know if you need a sample CSV or further customization.

rajenderk18: it didn't validate the email and give empty results for both valid and invalid emails

GitHub Copilot: The issue is that your CSV file uses the header `Email Address`, but the script is looking for the column `email`. As a result, it doesn't find any emails and outputs empty results.

I will update the script to handle the header `Email Address` and make it case-insensitive for robustness. 
```


Made changes.


```
The script now detects the email column name in your CSV file, including "Email Address" and similar headers, in a case-insensitive way. Please run the script againâ€”it should correctly validate and report valid and invalid emails.

rajenderk18: create a detailed readme file for this project so that anyone can understand the code and what it is doing

GitHub Copilot: Made changes.

A detailed README.md file has been created in your project. It explains the script's purpose, usage, features, error handling, and customization options so anyone can understand and use the code. Let me know if you want any additional sections or details.
