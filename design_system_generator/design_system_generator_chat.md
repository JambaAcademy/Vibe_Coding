<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">rajenderk18:</span> You're helping me build a design system generator. I'll describe component requirements, and you'll:
1. Generate visual mockups using text-to-image descriptions
2. Create React component code
3. Provide usage documentation
4. Suggest accessibility improvements

Let's start with a card component for a financial dashboard.


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">GitHub Copilot:</span> Great! Here’s how I’ll proceed for your financial dashboard card component:

1. **Visual Mockup Description**  
A card with a clean, modern look. It features:
- A prominent title (e.g., “Account Balance”)
- A large numeric value (e.g., $12,345.67)
- An icon representing finance (e.g., a dollar sign or chart)
- A subtle background color (light gray or white)
- Rounded corners and a slight shadow
- Optional: a small subtitle or status indicator (e.g., “Updated 2 min ago”)

2. **React Component Code**  
I’ll create a reusable, accessible React component with props for title, value, icon, and subtitle/status.

3. **Usage Documentation**  
I’ll provide example usage and prop details.

4. **Accessibility Suggestions**  
I’ll include ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and color contrast tips.

Let’s start by generating the React component code and documentation.

Here’s your financial dashboard card component:

1. **Visual Mockup Description:**  
A modern card with a title, large value, finance icon, rounded corners, subtle shadow, and optional subtitle/status.

2. **React Component:**  
Created as `FinancialCard.tsx` with props for title, value, icon, subtitle, and status. It’s accessible and visually appealing.

3. **Usage Documentation:**  
See `FinancialCard.md` for prop details and example usage.

4. **Accessibility Improvements:**  
- Uses `role="region"` and `aria-label`
- Keyboard focusable (`tabIndex={0}`)
- Sufficient color contrast
- Icon marked as decorative (`aria-hidden`)

Let me know if you want to customize styles, add interactivity, or generate more components!

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">rajenderk18:</span> Create a dashboard card component that displays:
- A metric title (e.g., "Revenue Growth")
- A large numerical value with percentage change
- A small trend visualization (sparkline)
- Color coding: green for positive, red for negative changes
- Clean, modern aesthetic suitable for B2B applications

Your dashboard metric card component is ready:

- **Component:** `DashboardMetricCard.tsx`  
  - Displays a metric title, large value, percentage change (color-coded), and a sparkline visualization.
  - Green for positive, red for negative changes.
  - Clean, modern B2B style.

- **Usage & Documentation:**  
  - See `DashboardMetricCard.md` for prop details and example usage.

- **Accessibility:**  
  - Uses ARIA roles, color contrast, and keyboard focus.

Let me know if you want to further customize, add interactivity, or generate more components!

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">rajenderk18:</span> Generate a text-to-image prompt for this card component:
"Modern dashboard card with clean white background, displaying 'Revenue Growth' 
title, '$2.4M' in large bold text, '+12.5%' in green with upward arrow, 
small green trend line chart, subtle shadow, professional B2B interface design"


<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">GitHub Copilot:</span> Here’s a text-to-image prompt for your dashboard card component:

Modern dashboard card with a clean white background, featuring the title "Revenue Growth" at the top. Below, display "$2.4M" in large, bold text. Next to it, show "+12.5%" in green with an upward arrow, indicating positive growth. Include a small green trend line chart (sparkline) beneath the value. The card has rounded corners, a subtle shadow, and a professional, minimal B2B interface design.

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">rajenderk18:</span> The card looks great! Now modify it to:
1. Add a subtle gradient background
2. Include hover animations
3. Generate a dark mode variant
4. Create TypeScript interfaces
5. Provide Storybook stories

Made changes.

Your FinancialCard component has been updated:

1. **Gradient background:** Subtle linear gradient for both light and dark modes.
2. **Hover animations:** Card lifts and shadow deepens on hover.
3. **Dark mode variant:** Toggle with the `darkMode` prop.
4. **TypeScript interfaces:** Props are fully typed.
5. **Storybook stories:** Added `FinancialCard.stories.tsx` with light, dark, and hover demo variants.

To resolve TypeScript errors, make sure you have `react` and its types installed in your project. Let me know if you need help with setup or further customization!

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">rajenderk18:</span> run the code

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">GitHub Copilot:</span> This project contains React/TypeScript code, not Python. To run or preview the FinancialCard component, you need to start a React development server (e.g., with Vite, Next.js, or Create React App), or use Storybook for component previews.

Would you like instructions to set up and run Storybook or a React app for this project? If you want to run Storybook, I can help you install and launch it. Let me know your preference!

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">rajenderk18:</span> proceed with it

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">GitHub Copilot:</span> Storybook is installing and starting up. Once complete, you’ll be able to preview and interact with your FinancialCard component in the browser.

If you need the Storybook URL or run into any issues, let me know!

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">rajenderk18:</span> run it

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">GitHub Copilot:</span> Storybook was not initialized in your project. You need to run the initialization command first.

To set up Storybook, run:
```
npx storybook@latest init
```
This will configure Storybook for your React project. After initialization, you can start Storybook with:
```
npx storybook
```

Would you like me to run the initialization command for you?

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">rajenderk18:</span> run it

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">GitHub Copilot:</span> Storybook initialization failed because your project does not have a `package.json` file. This means Node.js dependencies and project setup are missing.

To fix this:
1. Run `npm init -y` in your project folder to create a `package.json`.
2. Then run `npx storybook@latest init` again.

Would you like me to run `npm init -y` for you now?

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">rajenderk18:</span> run it

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">GitHub Copilot:</span> 

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">rajenderk18:</span> runt the programTypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module: http://localhost:6006/src/components/FinancialCard.stories.tsx

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">GitHub Copilot:</span> The error `TypeError: Failed to fetch dynamically imported module` in Storybook usually means your project is missing a proper build setup (like Vite, Webpack, or Next.js), or dependencies such as React and react-icons are not installed.

To fix this:
1. Make sure you have a package.json (run `npm init -y` if not).
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```
   npm install react react-dom react-icons
   ```
3. If you haven’t set up a build tool, install Vite for a fast React setup:
   ```
   npm install --save-dev vite @vitejs/plugin-react
   ```
4. Re-run Storybook initialization:
   ```
   npx storybook@latest init
   ```
5. Start Storybook:
   ```
   npx storybook
   ```

Would you like me to run these setup commands for you?

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">rajenderk18:</span> yes setup everything and run

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">rajenderk18:</span> create a detailed readme files to explain this project, code and what it is doing so that anyone can use it

<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">GitHub Copilot:</span> Made changes.

A detailed README.md has been created for your project. It explains the purpose, features, setup steps, component usage, accessibility, customization, and troubleshooting so anyone can use or contribute to your design system generator.

You can find it in the project root as README.md. Let me know if you want to add more sections or details!
