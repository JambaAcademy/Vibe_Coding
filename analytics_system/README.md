# Multi-Cloud Real-Time Analytics System

## Overview
This project provides a reference architecture and Terraform code to deploy a real-time analytics system capable of processing 100,000+ events per second globally, with sub-100ms latency in the US, Europe, and Asia. It leverages AWS, Azure, and GCP managed services for ingestion, processing, and storage, with a focus on cost optimization, auto-scaling, and data sovereignty compliance.

## Architecture Summary
- **Event Ingestion:** Kinesis Data Streams (AWS), Event Hubs (Azure), Pub/Sub (GCP)
- **Real-Time Processing:** Lambda/Kinesis Analytics (AWS), Functions/Stream Analytics (Azure), Dataflow/Functions (GCP)
- **Storage:** S3 (AWS), Blob Storage (Azure), Cloud Storage (GCP)
- **Analytics:** Athena/QuickSight (AWS), Synapse/Power BI (Azure), BigQuery/Looker (GCP)

## How It Works
### AWS
- **Kinesis Data Streams** ingests events regionally.
- **Lambda** processes events in real-time, auto-scales, and is cost-optimized.
- **S3** stores processed data in regional buckets for compliance and cost savings.

### Azure
- **Event Hubs** ingests events with geo-disaster recovery.
- **Azure Functions** process events, auto-scale, and integrate with VNETs for security.
- **Blob Storage** stores data with lifecycle management.

### GCP
- **Pub/Sub** ingests events with regional endpoints.
- **Dataflow** processes events in real-time, auto-scales, and is cost-optimized.
- **Cloud Storage** stores data with lifecycle rules for cost and compliance.

## How to Use
1. **Install Terraform:**
   - Download and install from https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html
2. **Configure Cloud Credentials:**
   - AWS: Set up credentials via AWS CLI or environment variables.
   - Azure: Use `az login` and set up a service principal if needed.
   - GCP: Use `gcloud auth application-default login`.
3. **Customize Variables:**
   - Edit `main.tf` files in each provider directory to set regions (e.g., `us-east-1`, `westeurope`, `asia-east1`).
   - Adjust resource counts, names, and lifecycle rules as needed.
4. **Initialize and Apply Terraform:**
   - Navigate to each provider directory and run:
     ```
     terraform init
     terraform plan
     terraform apply
     ```
   - Confirm resource creation.
5. **Deploy Processing Code:**
   - Upload your Lambda/Function/Dataflow code as needed (see cloud documentation for packaging and deployment).
6. **Monitor and Optimize:**
   - Use cloud-native monitoring tools (CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, GCP Operations Suite).
   - Adjust scaling and lifecycle policies for cost and performance.

## Data Sovereignty & Compliance
- All resources are deployed regionally to comply with data sovereignty laws.
- Storage buckets and endpoints are region-specific.
- IAM and encryption policies should be configured per provider for compliance.

## Cost Optimization
- Uses serverless and managed services for pay-per-use and auto-scaling.
- Storage lifecycle rules move older data to cheaper tiers.
- Monitor usage and adjust resource sizes as needed.

## Extending the Project
- Add analytics and visualization tools (Athena, Synapse, BigQuery, etc.)
- Integrate with BI platforms (QuickSight, Power BI, Looker Studio)
- Use multi-cloud management tools (Terraform, Anthos, Azure Arc) for hybrid deployments.
