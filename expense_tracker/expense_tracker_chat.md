rajenderk18: I want to build a simple expense tracker that can categorize my spending 
and show me monthly summaries. I'm new to programming but want to understand 
what I'm building, not just copy code.


GitHub Copilot: Great! Building a simple expense tracker is a perfect beginner project. Here’s a high-level breakdown of what you’ll need:

1. **Data Storage**: You need a way to save your expenses. For beginners, a simple file (like CSV or JSON) works well.
2. **Expense Entry**: A way to add new expenses, including amount, category, and date.
3. **Categorization**: Assign each expense to a category (e.g., Food, Transport, Entertainment).
4. **Monthly Summary**: Calculate and display total spending per category for each month.
5. **User Interface**: Start with a command-line interface (CLI), which is easier for beginners.

Would you like to build this in Python? It’s beginner-friendly and great for CLI apps. If yes, I can guide you step-by-step, explaining each part as we go. Let me know if you want to use Python or another language!

rajenderk18: can you build it in python with a gui. create all the necessary files and code

GitHub Copilot: Absolutely! I’ll create a simple Python expense tracker with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter (the standard Python GUI library). The app will let you:

- Add expenses (amount, category, date)
- View monthly summaries by category
- Store data in a local CSV file

Here’s the plan:
1. Main app file (`expense_tracker.py`) with the GUI.
2. Data storage file (`expenses.csv`) for saving expenses.
3. Helper module (`expense_utils.py`) for reading/writing expenses and calculating summaries.

I’ll create these files and explain each part as I go.

All necessary files for your Python expense tracker with a GUI have been created:

- expense_tracker.py: Main app with the Tkinter GUI.
- expense_utils.py: Handles saving expenses and calculating monthly summaries.
- expenses.csv: Stores your expense data.

You can run the app by opening a terminal, navigating to your project folder, and running:
```
python expense_tracker.py
```

Would you like a walkthrough of how the code works, or help running it?

rajenderk18: yes explain all the code and how to run it

GitHub Copilot: Here’s a clear explanation of each file and how the app works:

---

### 1. expense_tracker.py (Main GUI App)
- Uses Tkinter to create a window with two main sections:
  - **Add Expense**: Enter amount, select category, pick a date, and click “Add Expense” to save.
  - **Monthly Summary**: Enter a month (YYYY-MM), click “Show Summary” to see totals per category.
- Calls functions from expense_utils.py to save and summarize expenses.
- Handles user input validation and shows messages for errors or success.

---

### 2. expense_utils.py (Helper Functions)
- Manages the CSV file (expenses.csv) where expenses are stored.
- `save_expense(amount, category, date)`: Adds a new expense to the CSV.
- `monthly_summary(month)`: Reads the CSV and calculates total spent per category for the given month.

---

### 3. expenses.csv (Data File)
- Stores each expense as a row: amount, category, date.
- Used for both saving and summarizing expenses.

---

## How to Run the App

1. Open a terminal in your project folder (`expense_tracker`).
2. Run this command:
   ```
   python expense_tracker.py
   ```
3. The GUI window will open. You can:
   - Add expenses by filling the fields and clicking “Add Expense”.
   - View monthly summaries by entering a month (e.g., `2025-08`) and clicking “Show Summary”.

rajenderk18: create a detailed readme files to explain this project, code and what it is doing so that anyone can use it

GitHub Copilot: Made changes.

A detailed README.md file has been created in your project folder. It explains the project, code, usage instructions, and troubleshooting tips so anyone can understand and use your expense tracker.

You can open README.md in VS Code or any text editor to review or share it. If you want more details or have questions about any part, let me know!
